# Flashcord Language Packs
Repository of CSS Files containing Strings of Text for Flashcord's Multi-Language Support.

## Why this exists
Flashcord's next major update (currently code named Creator's Anniversary Update, set to release April 23rd) will no longer include every single language out of the box, the reason behind this change is due to the severe bloating concerns ever since the Worldwide Update. Only the English and "GangChat" languages will stay.

This repository is 100% open to contributions, if a language file is deemed complete, it will be hosted over sirio-network.com/flashcord/lang/[language-codename]
